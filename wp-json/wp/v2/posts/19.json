But those who own an older home can be facing money<\/p>\n<p>literally flying out the window through those old, drafty single-glazed windows. Cold air leaks into the<\/p>\n<p>home in winter, and the warm, heated air leaks out. In summer, it\u2019s the cooled air that escapes, as the<\/p>\n<p>hot, exterior air enters. It\u2019s time to stop the seeps.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you thought that storm windows are only there to protect your windows during a hurricane, think<\/p>\n<p>again. Storm windows are a high-quality, cost-effective, and proven solution for insulating the home.<\/p>\n<p>They significantly improve the interior comfort of the home by reducing air seepage by means of a<\/p>\n<p>thermal barrier created in the air space between the storm window and the home\u2019s window.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Studies show that installing storm windows can improve the energy efficiency of an older home by up<\/p>\n<p>to 30%. They also have the added benefit of providing noise reduction, preventing pollution and insects<\/p>\n<p>from entering through the cracks, and protecting valuable interior furnishings from harmful ultraviolet<\/p>\n<p>rays. And if you live in a hurricane-prone part of the country, they can also save your life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although installing storm windows does not serve the same function as window replacement, it<\/p>\n<p>certainly provides a cost-effective alternative that is worth considering seriously.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Storm windows do not replace your existing windows, and they do not require any modification of<\/p>\n<p>the exterior structure \u2014 an important factor for those who live in a home where the windows add<\/p>\n<p>character. Rather, they are an extra layer of window that can be installed on either the interior or<\/p>\n<p>exterior of your own windows. They can be temporary, removable fixtures, or they can be installed<\/p>\n<p>permanently.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Installing storm windows is a simple job that can usually be completed within a day using a drill,<\/p>\n<p>screwdriver, and caulking gun. Obviously, it is necessary to accurately measure the horizontal and<\/p>\n<p>vertical inside edges of the window casings and sash heights, and here\u2019s where it gets a bit tricky:<\/p>\n<p>because every window may not be exactly the same size, each window in the house has to be measured<\/p>\n<p>separately.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the storm window\u2019s frame must be properly aligned to the window of the house, and<\/p>\n<p>requires a tightly-caulked seal around its edges. Window sashes must slide easily after installation. If<\/p>\n<p>it\u2019s an exterior storm window, there must be a small \u201cweep hole\u201d in the caulking at the bottom to allow<\/p>\n<p>moisture drainage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although you can save some 15% of the total costs by installing storm windows yourself, be aware that<\/p>\n<p>unless you are a very experienced DIY\u2019er, it is a wiser to have them professionally installed, because<\/p>\n<p>there are always things that can go wrong and eventually cause damage to the structure of your home.<\/p>\n<p>Or, if the caulking is not done properly, you\u2019ll either trap moisture in the space between the two<\/p>\n<p>windows or allow air seepage into the home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A huge variety of models are available, and describing all of them is beyond the scope of this article.<\/p>\n<p>While your choice will be determined by your needs and budget, some of the most common features to<\/p>\n<p>look out for are described below.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For a permanent solution, choose Plexiglas or laminated glass. While plastic panels are less expensive,<\/p>\n<p>they can be scratched or turn yellow after a few years. On the other hand, this type of window is harder<\/p>\n<p>to break. Additionally, the depth of the sash tracks will affect the storm window\u2019s performance, as will<\/p>\n<p>the construction of the locks and catches. The type of track you select will depend on your budget and<\/p>\n<p>needs. The most common types are:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Double track \u2014 The inner pane move vertically<\/p>\n<p>Double track slider \u2014 The inner pane moves horizontally<\/p>\n<p>Triple track \u2014 Usually installed over double-hung windows. Each sash moves independently<\/p>\n<p>Picture \u2014 Single pane window that does not move<\/p>\n<p>Frame finishes are almost as important as the storm windows themselves, because they prevent<\/p>\n<p>seepage. Frames are available in vinyl, aluminum, or wood, and each type has its good and bad points:<\/p>\n<p>Vinyl \u2014 Energy-efficient and can be given the appearance of wood<\/p>\n<p>Aluminum \u2014 Strong and light, but a bad insulator<\/p>\n<p>Wood \u2014 Good insulator, but requires heavy maintenance. In addition, wood expands and contracts.<\/p>\n<p>Interior storm windows are installed inside the home. They are energy-efficient and easier to install<\/p>\n<p>than exterior models and, because they are inside the home, they cannot get damaged by the elements.<\/p>\n<p>However, they must be physically removed from the window for ventilation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who doesn\u2019t want to lower their energy bill?
