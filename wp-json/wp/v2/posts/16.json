The times they are a-changin\u2019, and today, professional mood lighting is<\/p>\n<p>affordable, easily installed, and adds value to your home. What\u2019s more, the choice is immense.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Deck lighting should be a central part of deck design. Properly planned, lighting allows you to safely<\/p>\n<p>enjoy outdoor living and entertaining late into the night, when the aesthetically-lit deck takes on a<\/p>\n<p>special charm and atmosphere. Lighting can transform the deck experience; it is also essential for<\/p>\n<p>illuminating stairs, walkways, and cooking areas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Most outdoor lighting is low voltage, running on a 12-volt system rather than the 120-volt household<\/p>\n<p>electrical current. This makes installation safe and easy, and keeps the energy bills low.<\/p>\n<p>But subtlety is the name of the game. Be aware that you must position the lights properly, and the<\/p>\n<p>fixture you choose must be appropriate for the lighting purpose \u2014 otherwise, critical areas like stairs<\/p>\n<p>can be shadowed over or, conversely, you and your guests may be blinded by glare. In addition,<\/p>\n<p>electrical wires must be properly secured or embedded in the deck design, so that children or elderly<\/p>\n<p>parents do not trip on them.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Solar-powered lighting can be a good solution for some areas of the deck if you live in a part of the<\/p>\n<p>country that enjoys high levels of sunshine, as this type of lighting must charge up with energy from the<\/p>\n<p>sun during the daytime. The good part about solar lighting is that it\u2019s environment-friendly, low cost,<\/p>\n<p>and doesn\u2019t require any wiring; the downside is that once the solar battery goes flat, the light switches<\/p>\n<p>off.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are building a new deck, or refurbishing an existing one, talk to your contractor about a<\/p>\n<p>lighting plan. If you are thinking of upgrading the deck lighting yourself, you should get professional<\/p>\n<p>advice before you start \u2014 creating a lighting plan for a deck that is both stylish and safe is not as easy<\/p>\n<p>as it may seem. Different parts of the deck call for different lighting solutions, and although today\u2019s 12-<\/p>\n<p>volt systems can be installed by any homeowner, the enormous choice of fixtures and lighting options<\/p>\n<p>means that experience, and a certain amount of expertise, are necessary to achieve the right look for<\/p>\n<p>your property while still maintaining safety.<\/p>\n<p>Deck lighting styles fall into three main categories, and a good deck lighting plan will use a combination<\/p>\n<p>of these three types to illuminate critical areas of the deck, create mood and atmosphere and, most<\/p>\n<p>importantly, make potentially hazardous areas safe. All three categories are low voltage and energy<\/p>\n<p>efficient.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Post Lighting \u2014 These fixtures are installed on the deck\u2019s posts and railings. They use downlighting, (that<\/p>\n<p>is, the beam of light shines downwards), to cast as much light as possible over critical areas, like stairs<\/p>\n<p>and steps.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accent Lighting \u2014 Uses downlighting to create mood and lighting interest by illuminating the main areas<\/p>\n<p>of the deck. Accent lights come in a huge variety of shapes and styles (for example, bowing buttercups,<\/p>\n<p>exotic mushrooms, or antique lanterns), and can be affixed to posts and railings, or the side of your<\/p>\n<p>house. Let your imagination run wild!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Recessed Lighting \u2014 This type of lighting is installed in the floor of the deck. You can walk on recessed<\/p>\n<p>lights without damaging them. They come in circular or brick shapes, and are usually small and low<\/p>\n<p>voltage, or solar powered. Use recessed lights to delineate the perimeter of the deck and the edge of<\/p>\n<p>the steps and stairway.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gone are the days when outdoor lighting consisted of one blaring backdoor porch light to illuminate the path as you took out the trash.
