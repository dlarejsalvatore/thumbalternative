This is a good way to add value to your home and<\/p>\n<p>some extra breathing room. Whether it is a master suite, family room, sunroom, or bathroom, this is a<\/p>\n<p>major project with many technicalities. You\u2019ll need to hire a contractor to handle the many dimensions<\/p>\n<p>of this work. You may be in for more than you realized, because you\u2019re living in the construction site<\/p>\n<p>itself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The hardest part of surviving a room addition is having strangers invading your home for a prolonged<\/p>\n<p>period. When you build a new home, you just move in when it\u2019s finished. It is just you and your family in<\/p>\n<p>your new home. Everything is clean and shiny, and it\u2019s all so very exciting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you are constructing a new room, however, there are strangers walking in and out of your home<\/p>\n<p>all the time. There\u2019s going to be a lot of dirt. Your life and that of your family will be disrupted, thus<\/p>\n<p>causing a lot of stress. How do you survive? Well, I did. I added a bedroom to my home and lived to tell<\/p>\n<p>the tale. This is how.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The first thing to remember when you hire a contractor is: look for more than price. Find someone you<\/p>\n<p>can work with. Your contractor is your partner in the project, and you must get along with your partner.<\/p>\n<p>This relationship must be better than \u201cyou pay your money and you get your service\u201d \u2014 it must be<\/p>\n<p>based on mutual trust and respect. Your contractor, and his workers, will be in your home for a long<\/p>\n<p>time. Therefore, if you get along well with each other, the work will go more smoothly. When problems<\/p>\n<p>come up \u2014 and they will \u2014 you can solve them with a lot less stress. Take this into consideration, as<\/p>\n<p>well as price, when you hire your contractor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It is important to set down rules at the beginning. You are going to have people in your house from early<\/p>\n<p>morning until late afternoon. They will need to eat lunch and use the bathroom. They will be near your<\/p>\n<p>things, such as your television, computer, CD, etc. Your privacy will be totally invaded, simply because<\/p>\n<p>they are there. In addition, when they tear down walls, build walls, put in floors, plumbing, and any<\/p>\n<p>other construction work, a lot of dust and dirt goes throughout your home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here are some rules to consider:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Negotiate hours for the work day \u2013 you may not want workers in the house when your kids are going to<\/p>\n<p>bed.<\/p>\n<p>Decide if the workers can smoke in the house<\/p>\n<p>Designate which bathroom the workers can use \u2013 you may not want workers walking all through the<\/p>\n<p>house<\/p>\n<p>Stipulate where you want the workers to eat their meals<\/p>\n<p>If necessary, designate certain parts of the house off limits<\/p>\n<p>Discuss with your contractor where the materials for construction should be delivered<\/p>\n<p>Stipulate that the workers must clean up everyday, when they are done.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You must negotiate these rules before the work begins. Consider putting themin the contract. Some<\/p>\n<p>of the rules are more important to specify in the contract than are others. For example, the rule about<\/p>\n<p>cleaning up is very important; make sure it\u2019s stipulated in the contract. The rule about where the<\/p>\n<p>workers eat lunch can be discussed with your contractor and left at that. The bottom line is: if it is<\/p>\n<p>important to you, put it in the contract. If something is in writing, it prevents misunderstandings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As in all relationships, problems can crop up. If you have a problem with a particular worker, bring it<\/p>\n<p>up with your contractor. He is the boss; therefore, he should handle it. I also found that if you treat the<\/p>\n<p>workers nicely and with respect, you can avoid a lot of headaches. Offer them coffee and some cake or<\/p>\n<p>cookies. You will be surprised what a little kindness and courtesy will do.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The stress of having all these people in your home may cause tension within your family. Speaking from<\/p>\n<p>experience, just getting away can bring relief. If you can get away for a weekend, then that would be<\/p>\n<p>great. If you can\u2019t, then just going out to dinner can really ease your mind.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The last and most important key to survival is keeping your eye on the goal \u2014 a beautiful new room<\/p>\n<p>with extra space to breathe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So you decided that your house needs expanding.
