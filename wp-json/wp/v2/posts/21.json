A hardwood<\/p>\n<p>floor complements any home design you currently have or want to create \u2014 from the traditional to the<\/p>\n<p>most modern, and anything in between. There are no boundaries with hardwood floors.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although hardwood floors have increased in popularity these days, they are not a new phenomenon. In<\/p>\n<p>medieval times people became increasingly tired of living on dirt surfaces, so they began laying crude<\/p>\n<p>planks. Things have changed for the better. With the help of modern technology, the art and science of<\/p>\n<p>wood flooring has reached new heights. Today, it is easier than ever for the average homeowner to have<\/p>\n<p>hardwood flooring. And the cost will not floor you!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the most desirable and important features of hardwood floors is easy maintenance. Through<\/p>\n<p>the years, higher quality coatings and sealants have been developed, thus eliminating the work that<\/p>\n<p>was once required to maintain the beauty of hardwood flooring. Hardwood floors require special care<\/p>\n<p>periodically, but the products on the market today are user friendly. You can keep them in top shape on<\/p>\n<p>a daily basis by a mere sweeping and dusting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hardwood floors are environmentally friendly: they are made from a renewable resource. People often<\/p>\n<p>use hardwood taken from old houses that are being torn down, and recycle it in their homes. Wood<\/p>\n<p>floors do not attract the dust that often collects on carpeting. If a family member has an allergy or a<\/p>\n<p>breathing disorder, this may be another reason for installing hardwood floors \u2014 it is a healthy choice.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to selecting flooring, there is a wide array of choices. Each type of wood \u2013 such as maple,<\/p>\n<p>ash, oak, and hickory \u2013 has its own grain and texture. Until a short time ago, \u201cexotic\u201d hardwoods from<\/p>\n<p>various parts of the world were accessible only to high-end commercial designers and architects. But<\/p>\n<p>today, these beautiful woods are available to you, the homeowner, in increasing varieties. Chestnut,<\/p>\n<p>Brazilian Walnut, Santos Mahogany, and Tiger Wood are a few of the options. In many cases, they are<\/p>\n<p>stronger and more durable than the classic choices.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In the past, no one would have considered installing hardwood floors in their kitchen. With all of the<\/p>\n<p>traffic and the risk of water damage, dings, and scratches, it was not practical. But with the availability<\/p>\n<p>of bamboo and walnut, the homeowner need no longer be concerned with dropping an item while<\/p>\n<p>cooking, or spilling liquids on the floor. Hardwood is not only feasible, but it is suitable flooring for the<\/p>\n<p>tough environment of the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After selecting the type of wood you want, you can choose from a wide range of varnishes and<\/p>\n<p>stains. For a more traditional and warm atmosphere, go with a darker color. For a more casual and<\/p>\n<p>contemporary feeling, a light stain works best. Depending on your tastes, you can have a floor with a<\/p>\n<p>glossy shine or a quieter satin finish.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>To add individuality, you can integrate designs and patterns into your floors. Gone are the days when<\/p>\n<p>one-length, staggered oak strips were the only possibility. Varied geometrical configurations, borders,<\/p>\n<p>medallions, custom stains, and hand painted designs are increasingly popular with homeowners. You<\/p>\n<p>can mix different species of hardwoods to give your floor a one-of-a-kind look. Consider combining<\/p>\n<p>wood flooring with other materials, such as stone, slate, or ceramic tiles. Anything goes!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are someone who loves the idea of hardwood floors, but also enjoys the quiet, warm, and<\/p>\n<p>cushiony feeling of carpeting, don\u2019t fret. You can combine the two in any room or hallway and have a<\/p>\n<p>beautiful blending of both worlds. One will accent and offset the other.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you consider your house to be an investment, with plans to sell it in the future, there is hardly an<\/p>\n<p>investment that will provide you with a more profitable return like hardwood floors. While many<\/p>\n<p>decorating fads and designs quickly go out of style, hardwood provides a timeless and classic quality to<\/p>\n<p>any home. Surveys done by realtors confirm that properties with hardwood floors sell faster and have<\/p>\n<p>higher price tags than homes with other types of flooring.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whatever your reasons for wanting hardwood floors in the home, you will not be disappointed. It is<\/p>\n<p>something people never grow tired of. The longer you have these floors, the more you will grow to love<\/p>\n<p>them. And if you don\u2019t believe me, ask anyone who has hardwood flooring.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Few remodeling projects can bring elegance to your home like the timeless beauty of hardwood floors.
