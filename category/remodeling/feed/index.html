										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What&#8217;s the Best Way to Add Beauty (and Value) to Your Home?</strong></p>
<p>Who doesn’t want a more beautiful kitchen? A kitchen you love and feel proud of every time you walk in? A kitchen that instantly raises the value of your property?</p>
<p>Yes, I know what you are going to say. You do want a new look for your kitchen, but remodeling costs thousands and thousands of dollars, and is a big, long headache.</p>
<p>Well, I have some good news for you. It doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>The best way to quickly and economically give your kitchen a brand new, stylish look? By Refacing your cabinets! Your cabinets can single-handedly add more beauty and value to your kitchen than any other makeover you can think of. And while getting a whole new set of cabinets is super expensive and could take weeks to complete, Refacing your cabinets costs a fraction of the price and can be done in just THREE DAYS.</p>
<p>It’s simple. When you get new cabinets, they rip out the whole of the cabinets, and all the shelves, and start building them from scratch. But you don’t need to do that! Your cabinet’s structure is sturdy and was built to last. Your cabinets just need a facelift!</p>
<p>Cabinet Refacing does just that. Just swap out, or cover, all the visible exteriors of your cabinets- including cabinet sides, doors, drawers, knobs and anything else that makes your kitchen look old- and replace with beautiful new woods and stylish materials. This gives you an entirely new looking, fabulous kitchen, and you still get to keep your familiar shelves and layout. And remember, it’s only a fraction of the price of new cabinets!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a comparison of getting a new kitchen versus cabinet refacing:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are like most people, the kitchen is undoubtedly the busiest room in your home. Whether it be for eating, food preparation, family meetings, telephone conversations, homework, or a quick cup of coffee before you run off to work, there always seems to be something going on in the kitchen.</p>
<p>At some time in your life, you will arrive at the decision that you want to partially or fully remodel your kitchen. To most people, it looms as an overwhelming project. There are so many decisions to be made. Here is some practical advice that will hopefully make the process easier. Before you weigh the all important issue of money, consider what your needs are.</p>
<h2>What is the main use of your kitchen?</h2>
<p>If you are a culinary artist who loves to prepare meals, think about how to design your kitchen so that you will have the counter space for practicing your craft, easy access to your tools, and a central location for your stove.</p>
<p>If you are an individual or family that eats meals together in the kitchen you want to be sure that there is enough room to comfortably sit around a table.</p>
<p>Perhaps you use the kitchen to eat, but are not big on cooking. You prefer to eat easy-to-prepare meals that you can pull out of the freezer or cupboard and pop into the microwave. In this case, plenty of storage space is a must.</p>
<p>It all boils down to the fact that the kitchen must reflect your lifestyle.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself about who you are. If you are a person who loves to work at keeping your kitchen sparkling clean, then glass, stainless steel, and shiny tiles are suitable for you. But if time or inclination prevents you from making this a high priority, choose materials that require less maintenance, such as blended colors and low gloss surfaces.</p>
<p>If you have an active family, you’ll want to be sure that whatever is installed will withstand lots of wear and tear. Extra sturdy cabinet doors and hinges, a heavy duty kitchen table, and easy to clean surfaces are a must.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to remodel only a part of your kitchen — right now, replacing the cabinets, changing the counter tops, purchasing a new stove or refrigerator, or redoing the tiling may be all that your plans include. If this is so, you want to make sure that your new items will match what already exists. Remindyourself that at some point, you may want to make other alterations. Don’t lose sight of the big picture. The options and possibilities can boggle your mind. In your city or town, there is surely at least one large kitchen design studio. Pay the studio a visit and you will receive many ideas. For example, you may see a layout that is not completely to your liking, but that still offers ideas; take them!</p>
<p>Many magazine racks or libraries have periodicals that deal exclusively with kitchen remodeling. Give yourself time to read a few; they offer a wealth of information.</p>
<p>Visit your local home center. Speak with neighbors, family members, and friends who have been down this road. Hear what they have to say.</p>
<p>Because there are so many decisions to make, give yourself plenty of time — do not rush into anything. For instance, don’t decide to remodel shortly before the holidays, or just before a major family event. Do not impose upon yourself hard to keep deadlines. Draw up a game plan.</p>
<p>Before you hire any contractors, ask for references and go to see the work they have done. Speak with more than one. And make sure that they are properly insured.</p>
<p>If you are doing a complete kitchen remodel, it may be preferable to work with a kitchen remodeling contractor who will assume responsibility for the entire project. Among the provided services should be a computerized 3D layout of your kitchen plans.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that building a new kitchen involves coordination among many trades: the cabinet maker, electrician, plumber, gas company, tile setters, countertop installer, and more. One person overseeing all of these craftsmen is a big plus.</p>
<p>While your dream kitchen is being worked on, you may find yourself inconvenienced. It is not uncommon for home owners to find themselves without water or electricity in their kitchens for a period of time. The room may remain a mess, the house a bit dusty. Chances are that you will have to eat some of your meals in the back yard, patio, or the local diner.</p>
<p>Schedule delays are not uncommon. Just when everything is going according to plan, an important appliance, fixture, or part will be out of stock. When the contractor is 100% finished with your beautiful new kitchen, there will be no tearful good-byes. But some of the frustration may be eased if you know to expect these setbacks.</p>
<p>Kitchen remodeling is not always easy, but if you plan and execute it well, the end product will make it all worthwhile. For most, this is a once-in-a-lifetime venture; so do what is right for you. Don’t let anyone push you into something that you do not want or need. Seek advice, but trust your own judgment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, be realistic about your budget limitations. Try to plan ahead and expect the unexpected. As the work proceeds, don’t be surprised to find that you want to make some adjustments; additional purchases may be required; the old stove may no longer fit in with the new design. You know how it can be, you buy a new dress, and then you realize that your old shoes don’t match.</p>
<p>Creating a kitchen that reflects your personality and suits your needs can be an exciting and fun-filled experience. It allows you to express your creativity in a way you never imagined. Hopefully, the ideas presented in article will set you in the right direction, and lead to many wonderful years in the busiest room of your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you decided that your house needs expanding. This is a good way to add value to your home and</p>
<p>some extra breathing room. Whether it is a master suite, family room, sunroom, or bathroom, this is a</p>
<p>major project with many technicalities. You’ll need to hire a contractor to handle the many dimensions</p>
<p>of this work. You may be in for more than you realized, because you’re living in the construction site</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hardest part of surviving a room addition is having strangers invading your home for a prolonged</p>
<p>period. When you build a new home, you just move in when it’s finished. It is just you and your family in</p>
<p>your new home. Everything is clean and shiny, and it’s all so very exciting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are constructing a new room, however, there are strangers walking in and out of your home</p>
<p>all the time. There’s going to be a lot of dirt. Your life and that of your family will be disrupted, thus</p>
<p>causing a lot of stress. How do you survive? Well, I did. I added a bedroom to my home and lived to tell</p>
<p>the tale. This is how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing to remember when you hire a contractor is: look for more than price. Find someone you</p>
<p>can work with. Your contractor is your partner in the project, and you must get along with your partner.</p>
<p>This relationship must be better than “you pay your money and you get your service” — it must be</p>
<p>based on mutual trust and respect. Your contractor, and his workers, will be in your home for a long</p>
<p>time. Therefore, if you get along well with each other, the work will go more smoothly. When problems</p>
<p>come up — and they will — you can solve them with a lot less stress. Take this into consideration, as</p>
<p>well as price, when you hire your contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important to set down rules at the beginning. You are going to have people in your house from early</p>
<p>morning until late afternoon. They will need to eat lunch and use the bathroom. They will be near your</p>
<p>things, such as your television, computer, CD, etc. Your privacy will be totally invaded, simply because</p>
<p>they are there. In addition, when they tear down walls, build walls, put in floors, plumbing, and any</p>
<p>other construction work, a lot of dust and dirt goes throughout your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some rules to consider:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Negotiate hours for the work day – you may not want workers in the house when your kids are going to</p>
<p>bed.</p>
<p>Decide if the workers can smoke in the house</p>
<p>Designate which bathroom the workers can use – you may not want workers walking all through the</p>
<p>house</p>
<p>Stipulate where you want the workers to eat their meals</p>
<p>If necessary, designate certain parts of the house off limits</p>
<p>Discuss with your contractor where the materials for construction should be delivered</p>
<p>Stipulate that the workers must clean up everyday, when they are done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must negotiate these rules before the work begins. Consider putting themin the contract. Some</p>
<p>of the rules are more important to specify in the contract than are others. For example, the rule about</p>
<p>cleaning up is very important; make sure it’s stipulated in the contract. The rule about where the</p>
<p>workers eat lunch can be discussed with your contractor and left at that. The bottom line is: if it is</p>
<p>important to you, put it in the contract. If something is in writing, it prevents misunderstandings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in all relationships, problems can crop up. If you have a problem with a particular worker, bring it</p>
<p>up with your contractor. He is the boss; therefore, he should handle it. I also found that if you treat the</p>
<p>workers nicely and with respect, you can avoid a lot of headaches. Offer them coffee and some cake or</p>
<p>cookies. You will be surprised what a little kindness and courtesy will do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stress of having all these people in your home may cause tension within your family. Speaking from</p>
<p>experience, just getting away can bring relief. If you can get away for a weekend, then that would be</p>
<p>great. If you can’t, then just going out to dinner can really ease your mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last and most important key to survival is keeping your eye on the goal — a beautiful new room</p>
<p>with extra space to breathe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few remodeling projects can bring elegance to your home like the timeless beauty of hardwood floors.</p>
<p>With hardwood flooring, you can create distinctiveness and value that will last a lifetime. A hardwood</p>
<p>floor complements any home design you currently have or want to create — from the traditional to the</p>
<p>most modern, and anything in between. There are no boundaries with hardwood floors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although hardwood floors have increased in popularity these days, they are not a new phenomenon. In</p>
<p>medieval times people became increasingly tired of living on dirt surfaces, so they began laying crude</p>
<p>planks. Things have changed for the better. With the help of modern technology, the art and science of</p>
<p>wood flooring has reached new heights. Today, it is easier than ever for the average homeowner to have</p>
<p>hardwood flooring. And the cost will not floor you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most desirable and important features of hardwood floors is easy maintenance. Through</p>
<p>the years, higher quality coatings and sealants have been developed, thus eliminating the work that</p>
<p>was once required to maintain the beauty of hardwood flooring. Hardwood floors require special care</p>
<p>periodically, but the products on the market today are user friendly. You can keep them in top shape on</p>
<p>a daily basis by a mere sweeping and dusting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hardwood floors are environmentally friendly: they are made from a renewable resource. People often</p>
<p>use hardwood taken from old houses that are being torn down, and recycle it in their homes. Wood</p>
<p>floors do not attract the dust that often collects on carpeting. If a family member has an allergy or a</p>
<p>breathing disorder, this may be another reason for installing hardwood floors — it is a healthy choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to selecting flooring, there is a wide array of choices. Each type of wood – such as maple,</p>
<p>ash, oak, and hickory – has its own grain and texture. Until a short time ago, “exotic” hardwoods from</p>
<p>various parts of the world were accessible only to high-end commercial designers and architects. But</p>
<p>today, these beautiful woods are available to you, the homeowner, in increasing varieties. Chestnut,</p>
<p>Brazilian Walnut, Santos Mahogany, and Tiger Wood are a few of the options. In many cases, they are</p>
<p>stronger and more durable than the classic choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, no one would have considered installing hardwood floors in their kitchen. With all of the</p>
<p>traffic and the risk of water damage, dings, and scratches, it was not practical. But with the availability</p>
<p>of bamboo and walnut, the homeowner need no longer be concerned with dropping an item while</p>
<p>cooking, or spilling liquids on the floor. Hardwood is not only feasible, but it is suitable flooring for the</p>
<p>tough environment of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After selecting the type of wood you want, you can choose from a wide range of varnishes and</p>
<p>stains. For a more traditional and warm atmosphere, go with a darker color. For a more casual and</p>
<p>contemporary feeling, a light stain works best. Depending on your tastes, you can have a floor with a</p>
<p>glossy shine or a quieter satin finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add individuality, you can integrate designs and patterns into your floors. Gone are the days when</p>
<p>one-length, staggered oak strips were the only possibility. Varied geometrical configurations, borders,</p>
<p>medallions, custom stains, and hand painted designs are increasingly popular with homeowners. You</p>
<p>can mix different species of hardwoods to give your floor a one-of-a-kind look. Consider combining</p>
<p>wood flooring with other materials, such as stone, slate, or ceramic tiles. Anything goes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are someone who loves the idea of hardwood floors, but also enjoys the quiet, warm, and</p>
<p>cushiony feeling of carpeting, don’t fret. You can combine the two in any room or hallway and have a</p>
<p>beautiful blending of both worlds. One will accent and offset the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you consider your house to be an investment, with plans to sell it in the future, there is hardly an</p>
<p>investment that will provide you with a more profitable return like hardwood floors. While many</p>
<p>decorating fads and designs quickly go out of style, hardwood provides a timeless and classic quality to</p>
<p>any home. Surveys done by realtors confirm that properties with hardwood floors sell faster and have</p>
<p>higher price tags than homes with other types of flooring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons for wanting hardwood floors in the home, you will not be disappointed. It is</p>
<p>something people never grow tired of. The longer you have these floors, the more you will grow to love</p>
<p>them. And if you don’t believe me, ask anyone who has hardwood flooring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who doesn’t want to lower their energy bill? But those who own an older home can be facing money</p>
<p>literally flying out the window through those old, drafty single-glazed windows. Cold air leaks into the</p>
<p>home in winter, and the warm, heated air leaks out. In summer, it’s the cooled air that escapes, as the</p>
<p>hot, exterior air enters. It’s time to stop the seeps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you thought that storm windows are only there to protect your windows during a hurricane, think</p>
<p>again. Storm windows are a high-quality, cost-effective, and proven solution for insulating the home.</p>
<p>They significantly improve the interior comfort of the home by reducing air seepage by means of a</p>
<p>thermal barrier created in the air space between the storm window and the home’s window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies show that installing storm windows can improve the energy efficiency of an older home by up</p>
<p>to 30%. They also have the added benefit of providing noise reduction, preventing pollution and insects</p>
<p>from entering through the cracks, and protecting valuable interior furnishings from harmful ultraviolet</p>
<p>rays. And if you live in a hurricane-prone part of the country, they can also save your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although installing storm windows does not serve the same function as window replacement, it</p>
<p>certainly provides a cost-effective alternative that is worth considering seriously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storm windows do not replace your existing windows, and they do not require any modification of</p>
<p>the exterior structure — an important factor for those who live in a home where the windows add</p>
<p>character. Rather, they are an extra layer of window that can be installed on either the interior or</p>
<p>exterior of your own windows. They can be temporary, removable fixtures, or they can be installed</p>
<p>permanently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing storm windows is a simple job that can usually be completed within a day using a drill,</p>
<p>screwdriver, and caulking gun. Obviously, it is necessary to accurately measure the horizontal and</p>
<p>vertical inside edges of the window casings and sash heights, and here’s where it gets a bit tricky:</p>
<p>because every window may not be exactly the same size, each window in the house has to be measured</p>
<p>separately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the storm window’s frame must be properly aligned to the window of the house, and</p>
<p>requires a tightly-caulked seal around its edges. Window sashes must slide easily after installation. If</p>
<p>it’s an exterior storm window, there must be a small “weep hole” in the caulking at the bottom to allow</p>
<p>moisture drainage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you can save some 15% of the total costs by installing storm windows yourself, be aware that</p>
<p>unless you are a very experienced DIY’er, it is a wiser to have them professionally installed, because</p>
<p>there are always things that can go wrong and eventually cause damage to the structure of your home.</p>
<p>Or, if the caulking is not done properly, you’ll either trap moisture in the space between the two</p>
<p>windows or allow air seepage into the home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A huge variety of models are available, and describing all of them is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>While your choice will be determined by your needs and budget, some of the most common features to</p>
<p>look out for are described below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a permanent solution, choose Plexiglas or laminated glass. While plastic panels are less expensive,</p>
<p>they can be scratched or turn yellow after a few years. On the other hand, this type of window is harder</p>
<p>to break. Additionally, the depth of the sash tracks will affect the storm window’s performance, as will</p>
<p>the construction of the locks and catches. The type of track you select will depend on your budget and</p>
<p>needs. The most common types are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double track — The inner pane move vertically</p>
<p>Double track slider — The inner pane moves horizontally</p>
<p>Triple track — Usually installed over double-hung windows. Each sash moves independently</p>
<p>Picture — Single pane window that does not move</p>
<p>Frame finishes are almost as important as the storm windows themselves, because they prevent</p>
<p>seepage. Frames are available in vinyl, aluminum, or wood, and each type has its good and bad points:</p>
<p>Vinyl — Energy-efficient and can be given the appearance of wood</p>
<p>Aluminum — Strong and light, but a bad insulator</p>
<p>Wood — Good insulator, but requires heavy maintenance. In addition, wood expands and contracts.</p>
<p>Interior storm windows are installed inside the home. They are energy-efficient and easier to install</p>
<p>than exterior models and, because they are inside the home, they cannot get damaged by the elements.</p>
<p>However, they must be physically removed from the window for ventilation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when outdoor lighting consisted of one blaring backdoor porch light to illuminate the</p>
<p>path as you took out the trash. The times they are a-changin’, and today, professional mood lighting is</p>
<p>affordable, easily installed, and adds value to your home. What’s more, the choice is immense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deck lighting should be a central part of deck design. Properly planned, lighting allows you to safely</p>
<p>enjoy outdoor living and entertaining late into the night, when the aesthetically-lit deck takes on a</p>
<p>special charm and atmosphere. Lighting can transform the deck experience; it is also essential for</p>
<p>illuminating stairs, walkways, and cooking areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most outdoor lighting is low voltage, running on a 12-volt system rather than the 120-volt household</p>
<p>electrical current. This makes installation safe and easy, and keeps the energy bills low.</p>
<p>But subtlety is the name of the game. Be aware that you must position the lights properly, and the</p>
<p>fixture you choose must be appropriate for the lighting purpose — otherwise, critical areas like stairs</p>
<p>can be shadowed over or, conversely, you and your guests may be blinded by glare. In addition,</p>
<p>electrical wires must be properly secured or embedded in the deck design, so that children or elderly</p>
<p>parents do not trip on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solar-powered lighting can be a good solution for some areas of the deck if you live in a part of the</p>
<p>country that enjoys high levels of sunshine, as this type of lighting must charge up with energy from the</p>
<p>sun during the daytime. The good part about solar lighting is that it’s environment-friendly, low cost,</p>
<p>and doesn’t require any wiring; the downside is that once the solar battery goes flat, the light switches</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you are building a new deck, or refurbishing an existing one, talk to your contractor about a</p>
<p>lighting plan. If you are thinking of upgrading the deck lighting yourself, you should get professional</p>
<p>advice before you start — creating a lighting plan for a deck that is both stylish and safe is not as easy</p>
<p>as it may seem. Different parts of the deck call for different lighting solutions, and although today’s 12-</p>
<p>volt systems can be installed by any homeowner, the enormous choice of fixtures and lighting options</p>
<p>means that experience, and a certain amount of expertise, are necessary to achieve the right look for</p>
<p>your property while still maintaining safety.</p>
<p>Deck lighting styles fall into three main categories, and a good deck lighting plan will use a combination</p>
<p>of these three types to illuminate critical areas of the deck, create mood and atmosphere and, most</p>
<p>importantly, make potentially hazardous areas safe. All three categories are low voltage and energy</p>
<p>efficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post Lighting — These fixtures are installed on the deck’s posts and railings. They use downlighting, (that</p>
<p>is, the beam of light shines downwards), to cast as much light as possible over critical areas, like stairs</p>
<p>and steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accent Lighting — Uses downlighting to create mood and lighting interest by illuminating the main areas</p>
<p>of the deck. Accent lights come in a huge variety of shapes and styles (for example, bowing buttercups,</p>
<p>exotic mushrooms, or antique lanterns), and can be affixed to posts and railings, or the side of your</p>
<p>house. Let your imagination run wild!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recessed Lighting — This type of lighting is installed in the floor of the deck. You can walk on recessed</p>
<p>lights without damaging them. They come in circular or brick shapes, and are usually small and low</p>
<p>voltage, or solar powered. Use recessed lights to delineate the perimeter of the deck and the edge of</p>
<p>the steps and stairway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps most of our time at home is spent in the kitchen. It’s the place where we eat our meals, have friends over for coffee, do homework, and even plan our daily lives. Yet in many homes, the kitchen’s décor is not up to standard. It’s old fashioned, it’s gloomy, and you hate it. Much as you’d like to do a total remodel, you just don’t have the funds available right now.</p>
<p>Well, take heart; it is possible to turn a drab kitchen into a fab kitchen — without breaking the bank — by changing just a few key elements and leaving any major structural work for better times.</p>
<p>Like all remodeling projects, a modest budget remodel needs some planning. You must set your budget from the outset, and then stick to it. Make an appraisal of the functionality: how much do you use the kitchen and for what? This will determine what new elements to install. Obviously, a kitchen décor designed for a New York loft is not going to suit a family with kids.</p>
<p>Be realistic. If you are planning to do a part of the work yourself, determine what you are and are not capable of doing. Take your plan and your budget to the contractor, and let him provide the services of electricians or professional carpenters, as well as give advice on materials.</p>
<p><strong>Change the Countertops</strong></p>
<p>Chances are that the countertop has seen better days. Yet it’s one of the most noticeable parts of the kitchen. Just changing the countertop can make an enormous difference in sprucing up the room. And there are many eye-catching options available to suit every budget, from laminates to beautiful polished granites or ceramic tile.</p>
<p>Then there’s the sink and the faucets: a brand new stainless steel sink will cost just a few hundred dollars. Or why not consider cast iron, ceramic, or stone? Faucets also come in a whole range of styles, from ultra-modern to vintage kitchen, in materials such as bronze, copper, brass, or shiny chrome. There’s so much  to choose from out there, that it’s never been easier to put together a killer look for your kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Remake the Cabinets</strong></p>
<p>Because new cabinets are usually one of the most expensive parts of redoing a kitchen, don’t rip them out for now, if you don’t have to. If their structure is good, you can give them a whole new look to match the rest of your new kitchen by replacing the knobs and handles, and refacing or refinishing the doors.</p>
<p>For example, you can have the center panels replaced with frosted glass, and then paint the surrounding wood a bright, cheerful color to blend in with the rest of the kitchen décor. Or, if you want to keep the wood look, have them refaced with a new, lighter wood veneer.</p>
<p>This is one area where we strongly recommend hiring the services of a professional. Even if you are the handiest DIY’er in the neighborhood, it is very difficult to achieve a professional result — and it can cost more to rescue a botched job than to hire a professional from the outset.</p>
<p><strong>Rethink the Lighting</strong></p>
<p>If your kitchen is old, chances are that the illumination consists of one large fluorescent fixture hanging over the center of the room. Yet lighting can drastically change the look of a drab kitchen. Recessed lighting, ambient lighting, and accent lighting are all good ways of making a lighting statement.</p>
<p>Install lighting under cabinets to highlight that new countertop — or even behind those new glass doors inside the cabinets — and illuminate the room with strategically-placed pendant lighting. The lights can be controlled by a combination switch.</p>
<p><strong>Color Those Walls</strong></p>
<p>The best value for your money in a budget remodel is a new coat of paint. Draw your color scheme from an item of interest in the kitchen, and take a good, long look at the multitude of finishes available, from faux finishes to high gloss. You can then select new, soft furnishings to coordinate with the new color. Changing the curtains is easy and eye-catching, and you can recover kitchen chairs using the same fabric.</p>
<p>We haven’t covered the subject of appliances or flooring. That’s because they represent a large outlay, which is beyond the scope of a budget remodeling project. But even here, there are solutions. To change the look of old appliances, have them covered with paneling that matches the new look of your cabinets. And flooring can be covered with a throw rug until you have the budget to replace it.</p>
